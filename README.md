**Please note: This project is work in progress! 
And as I do this in my spare time besides other 
interests it will develop steadily but slowly.**

# Welcome to Impresario

**Impresario** is the acronym for "**Im**age **Pr**ocessing **E**ngineering **S**ystem **A**pplying **R**eusable 
**I**nteractive **O**bjects".
It is designed for rapid prototyping of image processing solutions and testing of image processing algorithms
within these solutions. Therefore all kind of algorithms Impresario can make use of, are coded in separate libraries.

Everybody with interest in image processing is welcome to develop and hopefully share her own library. A simple C++ API 
allows to focus on the implementation of the algorithms and hides all the necessary interactions and data exchange between 
Impresario and the library from the developers.

Detailed information are available on the project's [GitHub pages](http://llibuda.github.io/impresario/web/index.html).
